Our members are full of great ideas, just like this one! Introducing Friday Night Lights, CrossFit Open WOD 18.4 with a “Spin”. That’s right, our resident CrossFit/Yogi/ DJ, John Bro, will be spinning the beats from 6PM this Friday night. Open athletes stick around to cheer on your fellow Asphodels and rehydrate with your Free FitAid, complements of FITAID Hong Kong . We can’t wait to see you all there!
