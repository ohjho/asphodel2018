On Saturday, the 27th of January, we will be holding our very first in-house competition at the new Kennedy Town Crossfit Asphodel! This will be an excellent opportunity to get to know our growing Asphodel community- both inside and outside of the gym. Featuring local pop-up vendors and CrossFit Kids demonstration, we hope you’ll invite friends and family to join us for a fun-filled day.

In-House Competition (9am to 12pm)
The in-house competition will begin at 9:00 am sharp. Teams will consist of two Asphodel members. Prizes and bragging rights to be won.

Launch Events (10am to 2pm)
CrossFit Asphodel will also welcome our local health community for the afternoon with pop-ups from local vendors with delicious food samples, apparel, and health services. Say hello to our new in-house partner, Motion Dynamics, who will be offering complementary postural assessment and alignments. Make sure you stick around in the afternoon to watch our smallest athletes in a CrossFit Kids demonstration.

This event is open to all and we can’t wait to see you there!
