<h3>A.  Snatch Balance 5 x 2</h3>
Every 2:30, for 12:30 (5 sets):<br/>2 Snatch Balances<br/>
<h3>B.  Snatch 3-2-1-3-2-1-3-2-1</h3>
Snatch<br/>– Set 1 – 3 reps  @ 65%<br/>– Set 2 – 2 reps  @ 75%<br/>– Set 3 – 1 rep  @ 85%<br/>– Set 4 – 3 reps  @ 70%<br/>– Set 5 – 2 reps  @ 80%<br/>– Set 6 – 1 rep  @ 90%<br/>– Set 7 – 3 reps  @ 75+%<br/>– Set 8 – 2 reps  @ 85+%<br/>– Set 9 – 1 rep  @ 90+%<br/>Rest as needed<br/><br/>These sets are known as "Wave sets" which create a bit of a different stimulus than the traditional building or stagnant sets
<h3>C.  Power Clean 7 x 3</h3>
Every 3 minutes, for 21 minutes (7 sets):<br/>3 Power Cleans<br/><br/>For these we want a 2-3 second pause in the catch position of the Power Clean
<h3>D.  Barbell Behind the Neck Split Jerk 5 x 3</h3>
Barbell Behind the Neck Split Jerk<br/>– 5 sets of 3 reps <br/>Rest as needed<br/><br/>Pause in the Split Position… the focus here is footwork and positioning so these sets should be relatively light
