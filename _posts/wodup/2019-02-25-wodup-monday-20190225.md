<h3>A.  15 minute AMRAP of Wall Ball Shots and Rowing</h3>
As Many Rounds and Reps as possible in 15 minutes:<br/>– 19 Wall Ball Shots @ 20/14 lbs<br/>– 19 Calories of Rowing<br/>

Men throw 20-lb. ball to 10-ft. target<br/>
Women throw 14-lb. ball to 9-ft. target

The workout begins with the medicine ball on the ground and athlete standing tall. After the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete will pick up the ball and perform the wall-ball shots. After 19 reps are complete, the athlete will move to the rower and pull 19 calories. The monitor must read 19 calories before the athlete can unstrap and move back to the wall-ball shots for the next round.

The athlete’s score will be the total number of repetitions completed within the 15-minute time cap. Each calorie completed on the row will be equal to 1 rep.

There is no tiebreak for this workout.
