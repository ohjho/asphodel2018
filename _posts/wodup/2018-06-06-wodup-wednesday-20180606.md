<h3>A.  Overhead Squat 5-3-1</h3>
Overhead Squat<br/>– Set 1 – 5 reps <br/>– Set 2 – 3 reps <br/>– Set 3 – 1 rep <br/>Rest as needed<br/>
<h3>B.  27-21-15-9 Rowing, Dumbbell Snatches, and Burpees</h3>
27-21-15-9 Reps for Time:<br/>– Calories of Rowing<br/>– Dumbbell Snatch @ 22.5/15 kg<br/>– Burpee<br/><br/>Today's WOD is very metabolic and the goal of this one is to find a pace and never slow down. The area that can slow you down is the burpees, so keep them smooth. Snatches are alternating reps!
