<h3>A. Alternating Sets: Front Squat, Shoulder Press</h3>
4 sets, starting a set every 2 minutes,  of:<br/>A1. 5 Front Squats (13X1 tempo)A2. 5 Shoulder Presses
<h3>B.  21-18-15-12-9-6-3 Wall Ball Shots and Chest-to-Bar Pull-Ups</h3>
21-18-15-12-9-6-3 Reps for Time:<br/>– Wall Ball Shots @ 30/20 lbs<br/>– Chest-to-Bar Pull-Up<br/><br/>Today's WOD should be between 10-15 minutes. Wall Balls will be hard to go unbroken so break them up into manageable sets with short rest. CTB Pull-Ups will be tough to go unbroken also, so the same applies.  Try to have a game plan of how you want to partition the reps and stick to it.
