<h3>A.  12 minute AMRAP of Push-Ups, Dumbbell Snatches, and Rowing</h3>
As Many Rounds and Reps as possible in 12 minutes:<br/>– 21 Push-Ups<br/>– 15 Dumbbell Snatches @ 22.5/15 kg<br/>– 9 Calories of Rowing<br/><br/>Scale the push up appropriately from the beginning.  Most of you are experienced enough to KNOW that you chest must touch the ground on the push ups.  For anyone having to be told this today will immediately have burpees instead of push ups.  Goal should be 6 rounds.  
<h3>B.  5 Rounds For Time of Rope Climbs, Running, and Wall Walks</h3>
5 Rounds for Time:<br/>– 1 Rope Climb 15 feet<br/>– Run 200 meters<br/>– 3 Wall Walks<br/>
