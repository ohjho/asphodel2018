<h3>A.  Heaving Snatch Balance 3-3-2-2-1-1</h3>
Every 2:30, for 15 minutes (6 sets):<br/>Heaving Snatch Balances<br/>– Set 1 – 3 reps <br/>– Set 2 – 3 reps <br/>– Set 3 – 2 reps <br/>– Set 4 – 2 reps <br/>– Set 5 – 1 rep <br/>– Set 6 – 1 rep <br/><br/>These are really "movement prep" sets for the snatches to follow.  These are not meant to be heavy sets.  The weight should be VERY comfortable and NO ONE should miss any of these!
<h3>B.  High Hang Snatch 10 x 1</h3>
Every 75 seconds, for 12:30 (10 sets):<br/>1 High Hang Snatch<br/><br/>Start these sets at about 70% of your 1RM…  we will be working towards a TRUE High Hang Snatch.
<h3>C.  Clean Grip Deadlift + Power Clean + Hang Squat Clean + Front Squat 6 x 1</h3>
Every 3:30, for 21 minutes (6 sets):<br/>Clean Grip Deadlift + Power Clean + Hang Squat Clean + Front Squat<br/>
<h3>D.  Shoulder Strength</h3>
"Rest – Pause" Neutral Grip DB Strict Press

Choose a DB weight you could knowingly perform 10 reps with.  You will then perform a max effort set of Strict Press with those DBs.  Once you fail, you will take 10 massive breaths then perform another max effort set.  You will repeat that no less than 3 times!<br/>
