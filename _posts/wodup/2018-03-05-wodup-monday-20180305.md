<h3>A.  1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 Dual Dumbbell Front Squats and Bar Facing Burpees</h3>
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 Reps for Time:<br/>– Dual Dumbbell Front Squat @ 50/35 lbs<br/>– Bar Facing Burpee<br/>Time Cap: 12 minutes<br/>

Prior to starting the workout, the athlete will need to set up a barbell, with standard plates, to jump over during the burpees. This workout begins with the dumbbells resting on the floor and the athlete standing tall. After the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete may lift the dumbbells to the shoulders and perform 1 squat. The athlete will then return the dumbbells to the floor and complete 1 bar-facing burpee. He or she will then complete 2 dumbbell squats and 2 bar-facing burpees, 3 and 3, etc. This portion of the workout is over when the athlete lands with two feet on the opposite side of the barbell after the final burpee, or when the clock reaches 12 minutes.

If the athlete completes all the squats and burpees before the 12-minute cap, he or she will use the remaining time to complete Workout 18.2a, a 1-rep-max clean. The clean must be performed with a barbell, and the plates must be secured with collars. The athlete may complete as many attempts as he or she likes until the time cap is up but will only receive credit for the heaviest successful lift. Plates smaller than 1⁄2 lb. may not be used, and the minimum weight increase will be 1 pound. The athlete may receive assistance from other people to load the barbell between lifts. Each athlete may use only one barbell for 18.2 and 18.2a, and male athletes must use a 45-lb. (20-kg) barbell.

The athlete’s score for 18.2 will be the total time it takes to complete all 110 reps or the number of reps completed at the end of 12 minutes. The athlete’s score for 18.2a will be the heaviest weight successfully cleaned, in pounds. If the athlete does not complete the squats and burpees in less than 12 minutes, he or she will not log a score for 18.2a.

Note: If an athlete chooses to scale 18.2, he or she will also have a scaled 18.2a score. An athlete who completes 18.2 as prescribed and fails to complete a lift will be ranked higher on the Leaderboard for both 18.2 and 18.2a than athletes who scale 18.2.

The official weight is in pounds. For your convenience, the minimum acceptable weights in kilograms are 22.5 kg (50 lb.), 15 kg (35 lb.), 10 kg (20 lb.) and 5 kg (10 lb.). Athletes lifting with kg plates will need to convert their weight to pounds prior to submitting.
