All reps should be reset at the bottom and not touch and go.
<h3>B.  5 Rounds For Time of Assault Bike, Deadlifts, and Medicine Ball Cleans</h3>
5 Rounds for Time:<br/>– 15/10 Calories of Assault Bike<br/>– 15 Deadlifts @ 100/70 kg<br/>– 15 Medicine Ball Cleans @ 15/9 kg<br/>Rest 2 minutes between each round<br/>
<br/><br/>Work on being consistent with your round times so that the rounds are within 30 seconds of your fastest round.  For your Med Ball Cleans work on getting under the med ball fast instead of curling the ball to your chest and squatting with it.
