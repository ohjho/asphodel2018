<h3>A.  Muscle Snatch 4 x 3</h3>
Muscle Snatch<br/>– 4 sets of 3 reps <br/>Rest as needed<br/><br/>The objective of this is not to find a 3RM… it is to work on acceleration through the middle of the pull as well as speeding up our "turnover".  Work up to a weight that is solid both technically and mechanically
<h3>B.  Power Snatch 4 x 2</h3>
Power Snatch<br/>– 4 sets of 2 reps <br/>Rest as needed<br/><br/>These do not have to be touch and go reps; they can be if you so choose…

Keeps your hips loose in between sets as you should most likely be moving towards a 1RM Squat Snatch in the next segment.
<h3>C.  Snatch 4 x 1</h3>
Snatch<br/>– 4 sets of 1 rep <br/>Rest as needed<br/><br/>Hopefully you feel good enough to hit 95% or higher.  This will also be a good test of "Lifting Plasticity" if moving from the power variation to squat.  <em>Take some time with an empty barbell to get the nervous system ready before getting into these…</em>
<h3>D.  2 Power Cleans + 1 Hang Squat Clean + 1 Jerk 1RM</h3>
Within 25 minutes:<br/>
1x 2 Power Cleans + 1 Hang Squat Clean + 1 Jerk @ 100%<br/><br/>Build to a 1RM Complex… enjoy!
<h3>E. Alternating Sets: Segmented Clean Pull + Clean High Pull, 12 Banded GHD Sit-Ups + 12 GHD Sit-Ups</h3>
3 sets, for quality,  of:<br/>E1. 2x Segmented Clean Pull + Clean High PullsE2. 12 Banded GHD Sit-Ups + 12 GHD Sit-Ups
