<h3>A.  Power Snatch + Hang Power Snatch 10 x 1</h3>
Within 10 minutes:<br/>
Power Snatch + Hang Power Snatch<br/>– 10 sets of <br/>Rest as needed<br/>
<h3>B.  3 Rounds For Time of Toes to Bars, Burpee over Partners, and Buddy Carries</h3>


In teams of 2:

3 Rounds for Time:<br/>– 40 Toes to Bars<br/>– 40 Burpee over Partners<br/>– Buddy Carry 200 meters<br/><br/>TTB may apportioned in any way, I.E. they do not have to be done in equal numbers among teammates. Partner Burpees should be performed like Lateral Burpees. Each teammate should do 2 at a time. 

One rep would consist of a Burpee, then a lateral jump over the teammate (lying face down on the ground). The 2nd rep would be the same, but jumping back in the opposite direction. Teams must alternate Burpees every 2 reps. 

The 200m Buddy Carry should be performed with one teammate carrying the other for 100m, then switching for the final 100m.
