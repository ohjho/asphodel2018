<h3>A.  For Time: Dumbbell One-Arm Overhead Walking Lunges, Dumbbell One-Arm Box Step-Ups, Strict Handstand Push-Ups, and Handstand Walks</h3>
For Time:<br/>– Dumbbell One-Arm Overhead Walking Lunge 200 feet @ 50/35 lbs<br/>– 50 Dumbbell One-Arm Box Step-Ups 24/20 inches @ 50/35 lbs<br/>– 50 Strict Handstand Push-Ups<br/>– Handstand Walk 200 feet<br/>Time Cap: 10 minutes<br/>

Measure the lunges and handstand walk in 5 foot increments.

NOTES

Prior to starting this workout, the athlete will need to mark a starting point on the floor, then measure out no more than 25 feet and make another mark on the floor at the finishing point. Additionally, marks must be made every 5 feet to create sections, each of which represents 1 rep of the lunge and handstand walk.

A box measuring 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep also must be marked on the floor in front of the wall where strict handstand push-ups will be performed.

This workout begins with the dumbbell on the floor and the athlete standing tall. After the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete will pick up a single dumbbell and lunge with it overhead for 200 feet. The athlete then will perform 50 dumbbell box step-ups with one dumbbell. After completion of the dumbbell box step-ups, the athlete will perform strict handstand push-ups. Once 50 strict handstand push-ups are completed, the athlete will handstand walk for 200 feet.

The athlete’s score will be the time it takes to complete the workout or the total number of repetitions completed before the 10-minute time cap.

EQUIPMENT 

– Dumbbell of appropriate weight for your division*†

– Box of appropriate height for your division (the top of the box must be at least 15-by-15 inches)

– Measuring tape

– Floor marks for the strict handstand push-up box

– Floor marks for the single-arm overhead walking lunge and handstand walk

* Kilogram dumbbells may not be used by athletes competing in the U.S. or Canada. If you are using adjustable dumbbells, the largest plates allowed are standard-sized 10-lb. (5 kg) metal change plates (9 inches in diameter). When the dumbbell is at rest, the bottom of the handle cannot be more than 4 inches off the ground. Any athletes using an unconventional or unmarked dumbbell will need to confirm the weight of the dumbbell on a scale and clearly show the height of the handle with a ruler or measuring tape in their video submission. Kettlebells, fat bells or other non-traditional dumbbells are not allowed.  

† The official weight is in pounds. For your convenience, the minimum acceptable weights in kilograms are 22.5 kg (50 lb.), 15 kg (35 lb.), 10 kg (20 lb.) and 5 kg (10 lb.).

If gym space is limited and a 25-foot lunge and handstand walk area is not available, athletes will be permitted to lunge back and forth in a smaller area so long as the 5-foot intervals still can be seen clearly.

For each workout, be sure the athlete has adequate space to safely complete all the movements. Clear the area of all extra equipment, people or other obstructions.

Any athlete who in any way alters the equipment or movements described in this document or shown in the workout standards video may be disqualified from the competition.

TIEBREAK

The scoring for this workout includes a tiebreak. The athlete’s time after completing the final box step-up will be used as a tiebreak time. Another tiebreak time will be recorded after the final handstand push-up is completed. When you submit your final result, your score will be the number of reps completed. There will be another field where you will enter the elapsed time at which you completed either your final box step-up or your final handstand push-up. In the case where two athletes have the same score (total number of reps), the athlete with the lower tiebreak time will be ranked higher.

If the entire workout is completed in under 10 minutes, your score is the total time it takes you to complete the workout.

Note: All tiebreak times must be reported in elapsed time, not in time remaining. Do not use a countdown timer.


<h3>B.  For Time: Dumbbell One-Arm Front-Racked Lunges, Dumbbell One-Arm Box Step-Ups, Elevated Strict Handstand Push-Ups, and Bear Crawls</h3>
For Time:<br/>– Dumbbell One-Arm Front-Racked Lunge 200 feet @ 50/35 lbs<br/>– 50 Dumbbell One-Arm Box Step-Ups 24/20 inches @ 50/35 lbs<br/>– 50 Elevated Strict Handstand Push-Ups 5 inches<br/>– Bear Crawl 200 feet<br/>Time Cap: 10 minutes<br/>

Measure the lunges and bear crawl in 5 foot increments.

NOTES

Additionally, marks must be made every 5 feet to create sections, each of which represents 1 rep of the lunge and handstand walk.
