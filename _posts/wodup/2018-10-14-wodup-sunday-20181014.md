<h3>A.  Hang Snatch 10 x 2</h3>
Within 30 minutes:<br/>
Hang Snatch<br/>– 10 sets of 2 reps <br/>Rest as needed<br/><br/>Begin with POWER Snatches… once the weight becomes to heavy to Power, change to SQUAT!  If you power more than you squat, begin with Squat, you will be squat snatching the entire time!

We should be completing one set every 3:00
<h3>B.  Power Clean + Push Jerk + Front Squat + Hang Squat Clean + Split Jerk 7 x 1</h3>
Power Clean + Push Jerk + Front Squat + Hang Squat Clean + Split Jerk<br/>– 7 sets of <br/>Rest as needed<br/>
<h3>C.  10 minute EMOM of GHD Sit-Ups and Deadlifts</h3>
Every 1 minute for 10 minutes (5 rounds):<br/><em>Minute 1</em><br/>– 15 GHD Sit-Ups<br/><em>Minute 2</em><br/>– 5 Deadlifts<br/>
