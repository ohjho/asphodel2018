## What is CrossFit Kids?
CrossFit Kids is a method for teaching CrossFit to children ages 3-18. Based on the principle of Mechanics, Consistency and then Intensity, CrossFit Kids emphasizes good movement throughout childhood and adolescence. Consistently good mechanics translates to physical literacy, enhanced sports performance and fewer sports injuries for kids. **Not only that, a vast body of research indicates that exercise is beneficial to cognitive function,** which means consistent adherence to the program can have a positive impact on children’s academic achievement.

**CrossFit Kids is meant to be BIG fun for all ages. Broad-Inclusive-General fun. Fun means we provide an active alternative to sedentary pursuits, which means less childhood obesity and all-around better health for our children.**

## Will my child be lifting weight?
For children under 12 years old, lifting weight provides next to no value in terms of strength (they do not yet produce enough testosterone to make lifting weight meaningful).  We break the program down between the following age groups: pre-school, primary school (6-12 years old), and secondary school (13 and over).

### Preschool 3-5 yrs old (Auntie Vee’s GymboVee)
These sessions last 20-30 minutes (short to keep the kids attention and not get boring).  We focus on playing games and building team-player skills.  This is fun for parents to watch too!

### Ages 6-12 (Ninja Training)
These sessions last 40-50 minutes.  We will begin teaching children the basics of lifting things (no weights or very, very light weights: e.g. 1-2kg).  We use games as a way to further develop and reinforce these skills.

### Ages 13-17 (Teens)
These sessions last a full hour, similar to adult CrossFit classes.  In these sessions, we will begin allowing the children to lift weight.  However, as their bodies quickly grow, it is our top priority to make sure their movement pattern is perfect prior to allowing them to lift heavy weights.  The program serves as a way for teenagers to cross-train for their school sports.  For teenagers who do not play school sports, the program is a great way to improve movement and build the necessary life skills for a long, healthy life.

## Will my child be safe?
All of our trainers have passed police background checks and have been qualified to teach these classes to Children.  For pre-school classes, we require a parent or guardian to remain on-site the entire time.  For ages 6-12, a parent or guardian is required to bring the child to the facility and to pick them up from the facility.  **We will not allow a child to leave with someone we do not know**, so we require all parents to introduce themselves to the coaches.
