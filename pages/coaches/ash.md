### Bio
My philosophy as a trainer is to develop great focus and patience in learning the fundamental movements in the beginning. **I feel safety and comfort is crucial** at first in order to develop the confidence to move on to bigger and better things. I want to create the muscle memory that is needed in highly coordinated movements so that one feels comfortable performing them in the more intense workouts that I will give once I feel an individual is ready. I think many people aren’t as in touch with their bodies as they think they are and by breaking down the highly dynamic movements and repeating them consistently one learns how to control their body’s motor recruitment patterns. As my clients adapt to these challenging movements both physically and mentally, their workout programs begin to grow in complexity and intensity. As this begins to happen, **clients naturally begin to start setting greater goals for themselves and it is my job to help them reach their goals.** In turn, their strength in character grows and they want to achieve much more than they ever thought they could accomplish.
