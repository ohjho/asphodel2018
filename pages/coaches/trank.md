### Bio
Taylor Rank, has over 10 years international experience in coaching.  He has worked under some of the most respected qualified Strength and Conditioning experts in the U.S. as well as many renowned CrossFit Coaches from around the globe.  Drawing on his knowledge and personal experiences as an athlete, Taylor can create, implement and adapt programs allowing his clients and athletes to reach their fullest potential.  

Taylor began his career after graduating from University of South Carolina in 2009 as part of the Strength Staff at Oregon State University.  There he worked across a multitude of college athletes in American Football, Women’s Volleyball and Soccer.  Later moving to Washington State University, he worked closely with both men’s and women’s Olympic sports teams.  

In 2011, whilst traveling through Seoul, Taylor was introduced to the sport of CrossFit, the “Sport of Fitness”.  Through his connections, Taylor was introduced to his now long-time friend, Cody Hunter, who later convinced him to make a permanent move to Seoul.  The two, along with a few others worked together to open the very first English-speaking CrossFit box in Korea which still exists today.  

After 3 years in Seoul, a unique opportunity presented itself to Taylor, allowing him to live and work in Hong Kong alongside his Father whilst coaching and building the community at Hong Kong's very first affiliate, Reebok CrossFit Asphodel.  Once again, through the amazing and ever-expanding CrossFit community, a year later Taylor was fortunate enough to receive an offer to extend coaching abilities and experience in Dubai.  

Now, after nearly 4 years in UAE, Taylor makes his return to Hong Kong along with his wife Larissa!  Reunited with the CrossFit Asphodel team, Taylor uses his enthusiasm and passion in fitness to help those around him attain their fitness goals and more!
