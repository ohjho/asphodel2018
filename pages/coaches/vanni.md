### Bio
Vanessa moved back to Hong Kong in 2010, and it was not until the fall of 2013 that she got exposed to CrossFit. Thanks to job changes from practicing landscape architecture to working in real estate property development. Since then, **the words “health” and “fitness” took on a completely new and inspiring definition which changed her life.**  

With her energetic and multi-disciplinary outlook and approach to life, in addition to her full-time job, Vanessa is a convener of [NarrativeHK][1], an initiative promoting positive attitude and increased confidence among her generation in envisioning the future of Hong Kong. She is also a co-founder of Quo Kefir Believers, a natural probiotic health food company. Her passion projects continue this year she pursues yet another venture in the fitness industry, as a co-owner and Director of Wellness Development of Reebok CrossFit Asphodel, the first CrossFit gym in Hong Kong.  

When she gets a free second from work, Vanessa loves to CrossFit, swim, bike and run, travel, name trees along her walks, daydream of possibilities in her city, make connections with people and the community, and above all, imagines what could be.
