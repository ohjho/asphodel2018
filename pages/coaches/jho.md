### Bio
John started Crossfitting with Reebok CrossFit Asphodel in 2012. And it has been his passion since. He believes in infusing fun and element of play into any form of rigorous physical training. He also believes that training for the body is training for the mind. Workout should be hard, yet body and mind should stay soft and flexible; always open to new challenges, training methodologies, and physical adaptations. Movements should link with breaths, as breaths are always intricately linked with the mind; and a balance can always be found somewhere between effort and ease. These are the principles that he always strive to share in his coaching and on the mat as a Yoga teacher.
