### Bio
Jacky was introduced to Crossfit in 2009 when he was looking for firefighting-related training programs to pursue his childhood dream in becoming a firefighter. Since then, competitive CrossFit, and the CrossFit has become an integral part of his life. CrossFit has made him into an all-rounded athlete – strengthening his physical and mental fitness to face the unknown challenges that he can encounter in life.  

Jacky strongly believes that **whatever your goal is, if you stay focused, determined, committed, and never give up, you will eventually get to where you want to be.** More importantly, he keeps a humble and open-mind, because **no matter how talented and good you are, there is always room to improve.** So, STAY HUNGRY and KEEP LEARNING!  

> “The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Never forget, within every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our condition.”
