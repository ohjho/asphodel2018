### Bio
Michael Holmgaard is our in-house Viking. Having lived and worked across the globe, his coaching
philosophy comes back to the fundamentals; learn the basics and then the rest will follow.  

Michael was deployed with the Danish military on Balkan for four tours, before becoming member
of the United Nations Protective Detail, which took him to places like Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Liberia.
His experience allowed him to work as a bodyguard instructor, paramedic responder in Cape Town
and Private Security in Iraq. After almost a decade in the world’s hotspots, Michael was offered a
position as a civilian instructor at the Danish military.  

His career in fitness began as Strength and Conditioning coach for a top European female handball
team in 2009. After finishing his first season, he moved to San Francisco to start his CrossFit
coaching career at the highly-famed San Francisco CrossFit under guidance of some of CrossFit’s top
coaches. Over the next 8 years, Michael worked internationally in Aalborg, Copenhagen, Hanoi, and
London as head coach at two affiliates and senior coach at four affiliates.  

Part of CrossFit HQ’s judging team at Regionals and three CrossFit Invitational around Europe,
Michael knows CrossFit. He continues to pursue his passion for travel and learning by attending
coaching seminars all over the world. Next goal, CrossFit L3 certification is just around the corner!  

Michael now calls Hong Kong home as a coach at CrossFit Asphodel.  
"Mechanics – Consistency – Intensity combined with a freaking positive mental attitude all day
long!" This is the oath of a Viking.
