By [Coach Glassman][1], founder and CEO of CrossFit.  

> CrossFit is a core strength and conditioning program. We have designed our program to elicit as broad an adaptational response as possible. CrossFit is not a specialized ftness program but a deliberate attempt to optimize physical competence in each of 10 ftness domains. They are cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, fexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy.
>
> CrossFit was developed to enhance an individual’s competency at all physical tasks. Our athletes are trained to perform successfully at multiple, diverse, and randomized physical challenges. This ftness is demanded of military and police personnel, frefghters, and many sports requiring total or complete physical prowess. CrossFit has proven efective in these arenas.
>
>In gyms and health clubs throughout the world the typical workout consists of isolation movements and extended aerobic sessions. The ftness community from trainers to the magazines has the exercising public believing that lateral raises, curls, leg extensions, sit-ups and the like combined with 20- to 40-minute stints on the stationary bike or treadmill are going to lead to some kind of great ftness. Well, at CrossFit we work exclusively with com-pound movements and shorter high-intensity cardiovascular sessions. We have replaced the lateral raise with the push press, the curl with the pull-up, and the leg extension with the squat. For every long-distance efort our athletes will do fve or six at short distance. Why? Because functional movements and high intensity are radically more efective at eliciting nearly any desired ftness result. Startlingly, this is not a matter of opinion but solid, irrefut-able scientifc fact, and yet the marginally efective old ways persist and are nearly universal. Our approach is consistent with what is practiced in elite training programs associated with major university athletic teams and professional sports. CrossFit endeavors to bring state-of-the-art coaching techniques to the general public and athlete.
