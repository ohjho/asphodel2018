  bio: "My philosophy as a trainer is to develop great focus and patience in learning the fundamental movements in the beginning. I feel safety and comfort is crucial at first in order to develop the confidence to move on to bigger and better things. I want to create the muscle memory that is needed in highly coordinated movements so that one feels comfortable performing them in the more intense workouts that I will give once I feel an individual is ready. I think many people aren’t as in touch with their bodies as they think they are and by breaking down the highly dynamic movements and repeating them consistently one learns how to control their body’s motor recruitment patterns. As my clients adapt to these challenging movements both physically and mentally, their workout programs begin to grow in complexity and intensity. As this begins to happen, clients naturally begin to start setting greater goals for themselves and it is my job to help them reach their goals. In turn, their strength in character grows and they want to achieve much more than they ever thought they could accomplish."

  bio: "Vanessa moved back to Hong Kong in 2010, and it was not until the fall of 2013 that she got exposed to CrossFit. Thanks to job changes from practicing landscape architecture to working in real estate property development. Since then, the words 'health' and 'fitness' took on a completely new and inspiring definition which changed her life.

  With her energetic and multi-disciplinary outlook and approach to life, in addition to her full-time job, Vanessa is a convener of NarrativeHK, an initiative promoting positive attitude and increased confidence among her generation in envisioning the future of Hong Kong. She is also a co-founder of Quo Kefir Believers, a natural probiotic health food company. Her passion projects continue this year she pursues yet another venture in the fitness industry, as a co-owner and Director of Wellness Development of Reebok CrossFit Asphodel, the first CrossFit gym in Hong Kong.

  When she gets a free second from work, Vanessa loves to CrossFit, swim, bike and run, travel, name trees along her walks, daydream of possibilities in her city, make connections with people and the community, and above all, imagines what could be."

  bio: "Victoria is the only female coach at CrossFit Asphodel and an accomplished CrossFit Regionals athlete. She masterfully balances the passions of coaching and training, and she finds great reward in seeing athletes of all levels excel in the Sport of Fitness. Victoria draws from experience in New Zealand, Hong Kong, China and Hawaii to offer diversity in warm-up drills, scaling options, programming, personal training, nutritional advice and more. With a head coaching background at two affiliates, she is a credible instructor, who promotes solid technique before load and speed. After all, competition has taught Victoria that efficiency in movement is rooted in virtuosity: doing the common uncommonly well.
Originally from Brazil, Victoria started CrossFitting in 2013 while living in New Zealand, because it was often too cold to play soccer or surf. In October 2014, she moved to Hong Kong and China to expand her teaching and training career. Victoria also enjoys surfing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, soccer, skateboarding, traveling and eating."

  bio: "John started Crossfitting with Reebok CrossFit Asphodel in 2012. And it has been his passion since. He believes in infusing fun and element of play into any form of rigorous physical training. He also believes that training for the body is training for the mind. Workout should be hard, yet body and mind should stay soft and flexible; always open to new challenges, training methodologies, and physical adaptations. Movements should link with breaths, as breaths are always intricately linked with the mind; and a balance can always be found somewhere between effort and ease. These are the principles that he always strive to share in his coaching and on the mat as a Yoga teacher."

Since then, competitive CrossFit, and the CrossFit has become an integral part of his life. CrossFit has made him into an all-rounded athlete – strengthening his physical and mental fitness to face the unknown challenges that he can encounter in life.

Jacky strongly believes that whatever your goal is, if you stay focused, determined, committed, and never give up, you will eventually get to where you want to be. More importantly, he keeps a humble and open-mind, because no matter how talented and good you are, there is always room to improve. So, STAY HUNGRY and KEEP LEARNING!
